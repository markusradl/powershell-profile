# üé® PowerShell Profile (Pretty PowerShell)

A stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.
This is an ausome Profile from Chris Titus Tech. I have made some changes to it to make it more personal.

## ‚ö° One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```
irm "https://github.com/markusradl/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll find a downloaded `cove.zip` file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the required nerd fonts:

1. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
2. Locate and install the nerd fonts.

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! üöÄ
